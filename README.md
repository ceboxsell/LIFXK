# LIFXK
LIFX service for Kodi

This is for me and the version I use that works well using HTTP API V1. I created it years ago and sorry prob won't work. going to start from scratch me thinks. Abmient sucks, I don't need the distraction and the screen shots take up too much CPU time when watching 1080P movies 

I might convert it to LAN API if I can ever bother and might do an option for Ambient mode using LAN api setting the lights to the average colour of the screen.
